Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  # HTTP VERB EXAMPLES
  #
  # The word "Record" usually means an item in the database
  #
  # GET => Used to get information
  # POST => Used to create new records
  # PUT => Used to update existing records
  # DELETE => Used to delete records

  # All of these examples do the same thing, but
  # using different HTTP verbs

  # Only GET works from a browser URL
  get 'example1', to: "example#example1"
  # curl localhost:3000/example1

  put 'example1', to: "example#example1"
  # curl - X PUT localhost:3000/example1

  post 'example1', to: "example#example1"
  # curl - X POST localhost:3000/example1

  delete 'example1', to: "example#example1"
  # curl - X DELETE localhost:3000/example1

  # These examples use different HTTP verbs to route to different methods
  put 'example', to: "example#example_put"
  # curl -X PUT localhost:3000/example

  post 'example', to: "example#example_post"
  # curl -X POST localhost:3000/example



  # EXAMPLES FOR ROUTES AND CONTROLLERS
  # and how to execute ruby in a controller

  # Example URL: localhost:3000/example1
  get 'example1', to: "example#example1"

  # Example URL: localhost:3000/example2?number=100
  get 'example2', to: "example#example2"


  # Example URL: localhost:3000/example3?number=100&number2=11
  get 'example3', to: "example#example3"

  # Example URL: localhost:3000/but-why
  get 'but-why', to: "example#proof_you_can_name_this_whatever_123_abc"


  # More advanced ruby examples
  # These use the alternative syntax to specify controller and action
  get 'rock_paper_scissors', controller: 'games', action: 'rock_paper_scissors'
  get 'state_search', controller: 'search', action: 'state_filter'




  # EXERCISES:
  #
  # INSTRUCTIONS:
  # For the following exercises, create a single controller called "ExercisesController"
  # by calling `rails g controller exercises` on the command line
  # in the file controllers/exercises_controller.rb
  # Each of the exercises should be it's own action


  # 1. Write something about yourself and return it to the browser

  #   - Create a controller action (method): "my_info"
  #   - Create a route that maps localhost/my_info to ExercisesController#my_info
  #   - render your name


  # 2. Random number generator
  #   - Use the "rand" method to pick a random number and return it

  # 3. Print current time and date

  # 4. Pick a random state
  #   - Create an array of all states
  #   - Pick one randomly

  # 5. Open up test/controllers/example_controller_test.rb
  # write tests for put, post, and delete to example1

  # 6. Fizzbuzz:
  #  This is the infamous fizzbuzz problem
  #  All software devs should be comfortable solving this
  #  in an interview setting on a whiteboard
  #
  #
  #  The fizzbuzz problem has the following requirements:
  #
  #  When a number is a multiple of 3, print fizz
  #  When a number is a multiple of 5, print buzz
  #  When a number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz
  #
  #  This code prints all numbers from 1 to 100, replacing the words
  #  that match the above rules

  # 7. Tests:
  # Write tests for each of the controller methods in exercises!

  # EXERCISES WITH PARAMS:
  # The following exercises require query params
  # eg. http://localhost:3000/my_url?param1=Hello&param2=World
  #
  # The examples for query params can be found in the section: "EXAMPLES FOR ROUTES AND CONTROLLERS"

  # 1. Get the value of a query param and return it to the browser (See Example 2 above)

  # 2. Add two numbers together (See Example 3 above)

  # 3. Check if two query params are equal

  # 4. Check if query param is in an array

end
